// Possible table ideas

// Table 1: user
// has the username, and number record of played adventures, maybe a score system. 

// table 2: adventures
// has the name, short description of adventure, and number of scenarios

// table 3: Explorer
// has name based of username(foreign key), the scenario the explorer is currently in, Booleans based on if they have items or not.
